## Lessons Learnt

One of the lessons I learnt with this project was the importance of maintaining consistent code abstractions and good architecture. By standardizing how features and functionality were abstracted—whether through PHP OOP, a custom ORM or an MVC implementation—it became easier to understand, debug and extend/scale the project. Consistent abstractions ensured that the codebase followed good design principles and not only did that improve maintainability, but streamlined development and made it easier to adhere to a cohesive development workflow.
